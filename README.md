  * Python built-in tkinter library.
  * Converter third-party package written by me. This package is also included in this repository and you can get it [here](/converter).

## Installing and running 

There are two ways you can test/run/use Unit Converter without the requirement of having python set up on your computer. You can run the [standalone](/dist/Unit Converter.zip)
directly, or you can install the [setup](/dist/Unit-converter-setup.exe). The only difference between either of them is that installing the [setup](/dist/Unit-converter-setup.exe)
would add Unit Converter to the list of other installed applications in your Windows OS and a start menu shortcut would be created. 

To use the standalone, download the zipped file from [here](/dist/Unit Converter.zip). Unzip the downloaded zip file into a folder of your choice, search for 
**Unit Converter.exe** and double click on it to run application. 

To install the setup, download the [setup exe](/dist/Unit-Converter-Setup.exe). Run the downloaded setup and follow the steps provided by the setup for proper installation.
