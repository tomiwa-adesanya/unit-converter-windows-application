## Installing and running Application

There are two ways you can test/run/use Unit Converter without the requirement of having python set up on your computer. You can run the [standalone](https://github.com/tomiwa-adesanya/unit-converter-windows-application/raw/master/dist/Unit%20Converter.zip)
directly, or you can install the [setup](https://github.com/tomiwa-adesanya/unit-converter-windows-application/raw/master/dist/Unit-Converter-Setup.exe). The  difference between them is that installing the [setup](https://github.com/tomiwa-adesanya/unit-converter-windows-application/raw/master/dist/Unit-Converter-Setup.exe)
